A full stack project which integrates the front end and backend of a e-commerce website for books.
I have used Thymeleaf as a template engine, javascript and Bootstrap for the front end 
while for the backend, I used Java and Spring Boot. 
The database for the project was created in MySQL and data ws persisted by using hibernate
